# Smart-Lighting
This project utilizes 3 Raspberry Pis each connected to its own light strip. The light strip will automatically turn on and off based on BLE localization of the Android Wear Device in relation to each of the Pis. The Wear OS app will also allow for dimming of the lights based on gesture control
